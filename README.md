## Installation

```sh
pip install magentic
```

or using poetry

```sh
poetry add magentic
```

Configure your OpenAI API key by setting the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable or using `openai.api_key = "sk-..."`. See the [OpenAI Python library documentation](https://github.com/openai/openai-python#usage) for more information.

## Usage

The `@prompt` decorator allows you to define a template for a Large Language Model (LLM) prompt as a Python function. When this function is called, the arguments are inserted into the template, then this prompt is sent to an LLM which generates the function output.

```python
from magentic import prompt


@prompt('Add more "dude"ness to: {phrase}')
def dudeify(phrase: str) -> str:
    ...  # No function body as this is never executed


dudeify("Hello, how are you?")
# "Hey, dude! What's up? How's it going, my man?"
```

The `@prompt` decorator will respect the return type annotation of the decorated function. This can be [any type supported by pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/types/types/) including a `pydantic` model.

```python
from magentic import prompt
from pydantic import BaseModel


class Superhero(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int
    power: str
    enemies: list[str]


@prompt("Create a Superhero named {name}.")
def create_superhero(name: str) -> Superhero:
    ...


create_superhero("Garden Man")
# Superhero(name='Garden Man', age=30, power='Control over plants', enemies=['Pollution Man', 'Concrete Woman'])
```

An LLM can also decide to call functions. In this case the `@prompt`-decorated function returns a `FunctionCall` object which can be called to execute the function using the arguments provided by the LLM.

```python
from typing import Literal

from magentic import prompt, FunctionCall


def activate_oven(temperature: int, mode: Literal["broil", "bake", "roast"]) -> str:
    """Turn the oven on with the provided settings."""
    return f"Preheating to {temperature} F with mode {mode}"


@prompt(
    template="Prepare the oven so I can make {food}",
    functions=[activate_oven],
)
def configure_oven(food: str) -> FunctionCall[str]:
    ...


output = configure_oven("cookies!")
# FunctionCall(<function activate_oven at 0x1105a6200>, temperature=350, mode='bake')
output()
# 'Preheating to 350 F with mode bake'
```

Sometimes the LLM requires making one or more function calls to generate a final answer. The `@prompt_chain` decorator will resolve `FunctionCall` objects automatically and pass the output back to the LLM to continue until the final answer is reached.

In the following example, when `describe_weather` is called the LLM first calls the `get_current_weather` function, then uses the result of this to formulate its final answer which gets returned.

```python
from magentic import prompt_chain


def get_current_weather(location, unit="fahrenheit"):
    """Get the current weather in a given location"""
    # Pretend to query an API
    return {
        "location": location,
        "temperature": "72",
        "unit": unit,
        "forecast": ["sunny", "windy"],
    }


@prompt_chain(
    template="What's the weather like in {city}?",
    functions=[get_current_weather],
)
def describe_weather(city: str) -> str:
    ...


describe_weather("Boston")
# 'The current weather in Boston is 72Â°F and it is sunny and windy.'
```

LLM-powered functions created using `@prompt` and `@prompt_chain` can be supplied as `functions` to other `@prompt`/`@prompt_chain` decorators, just like regular python functions. This enables increasingly complex LLM-powered functionality, while allowing individual components to be tested and improved in isolation.

### Additional Features

- The `@prompt` decorator can also be used with `async` function definitions.
- The docstring of the decorated function will be used as the prompt template if the `template` argument is not provided to `@prompt`/`@prompt_chain`.
- The `Annotated` type annotation can be used to provide descriptions and other metadata for function parameters. See [the pydantic documentation on using `Field` to describe function arguments](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/validation_decorator/#using-field-to-describe-function-arguments).
- The `@prompt` and `@prompt_chain` decorators also accept a `model` argument. You can pass an instance of `OpenaiChatModel` (from `magentic.chat_model.openai_chat_model`) to use GPT4 or configure a different temperature.

## Type Checking

Many type checkers will raise warnings or errors for functions with the `prompt` decorator due to the function having no body or return value. There are several ways to deal with these.

1. Disable the check globally for the type checker. For example in mypy by disabling error code `empty-body`.
   ```toml
   # pyproject.toml
   [tool.mypy]
   disable_error_code = ["empty-body"]
   ```
1. Make the function body `...` (this does not satisfy mypy) or `raise`.
   ```python
   @prompt()
   def random_color() -> str:
       """Choose a color"""
       ...
   ```
1. Use comment `# type: ignore[empty-body]` on each function.
   ```python
   @prompt()
   def random_color() -> str:  # type: ignore[empty-body]
       """Choose a color"""
   ```
