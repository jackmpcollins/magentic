"""A simple quiz game.

This example improves on the `1_quiz.py` example by using streaming to generate the questions. In `1_quiz.py` the
questions were generated concurrently which allowed the quiz to start quickly but meant there was a chance of duplicate
questions being generated. In this example the questions are streamed which allows us to show the first question to the
user as soon as it is ready, while still making a single query to the LLM which avoids generating duplicate questions.

The only change from `0_quiz.py` is the return type annotations of the `generate_questions` function changing from
`list[Question]` to `Iterable[Question]`. This allows us to iterate through the questions as they are generated.
